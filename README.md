# React Portfolio
  
## As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. In this project, I need to create a React Portfolio that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When I load the portfolio, then i should be presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
  2. When I view the header, then I should be presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
  3. When I view the navigation titles, then I should be presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
  4. When I click on a navigation title, then i should be presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
  5. When I load the portfolio the first time, then the About Me title and section are selected by default.
  6. When I am presented with the About Me section, then I should see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
  7. When I am presented with the Portfolio section, then I should see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.
  8. When I am presented with the Contact section, then I should see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
  9. When I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, then I should receive a notification that this field is required.
  10. When I enter text into the email address field, then I should receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
  11. When I am presented with the Resume section, then I should see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
  12. When I view the footer, then I should be presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
